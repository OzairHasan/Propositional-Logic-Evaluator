# Propositional-Logic-Evaluator
Simple program that takes a propositional logic argument as input and outputs the validity of the argument.

Propositional Logic Evaluator (No quantificational).py works as expected on propositional logic arguments. 

Propositional Logic Evaluator.py does not work as expected for the quantification arguments and future work and organization is required.
